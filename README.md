### Useful resources

- [CSS Documentation](https://www.w3schools.com/css/) - This helped me how to handle div containers and style them. I really liked this pattern and will use it going forward.
- [CSS Flexbox](https://css-tricks.com/snippets/css/a-guide-to-flexbox/) - This is an amazing article which helped me finally understand CSS Flexbox. I'd recommend it to anyone still learning this concept.
